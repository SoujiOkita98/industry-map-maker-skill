## 3) a16z article context (2026 lens)

Reference: https://a16z.com/anime-is-eating-the-world/ (published 2024-09-23)

Usefulness:
- Strong on strategic thesis (anime becoming global default internet-native culture).
- Good for narrative framing and why-this-matters in an investment memo.

Limitations for IC-grade underwriting in 2026:
- Not a replacement for current, source-audited market model.
- Some examples/company snapshots in the article may be stale by 2026.
- Need 2025/2026 primary filings and operating metrics to support valuation decisions.

## 4) What would make this Sequoia/a16z-partner ready

- Every number tagged with: `source`, `as_of_date`, `confidence`, `method`.
- Every graph edge tagged with: `evidence_type` (`official contract` / `official filing` / `case study` / `inference`).
- Facts and hypotheses rendered separately in UI.
- A single USD model sheet with reproducible conversions and no mixed-currency display.
