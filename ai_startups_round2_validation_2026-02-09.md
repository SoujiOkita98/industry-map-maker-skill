# AI Startup Validation Round 2 (B2B-focused)

Validated on 2026-02-09 using official company pages.

## Selection rule
Only added startups with clear production use-cases in game/animation/dubbing pipelines (not generic AI tools).

## Added startups + strong relevance

1. Scenario (`scenario.com`)
- Why strong: Official positioning as AI content generation platform for gaming/media workflows and assets.
- Sources:
  - https://scenario.com/
  - https://docs.scenario.com/
- Added map applications:
  - `scenario -> mihoyo` (game asset generation pipeline)
  - `scenario -> papergames` (concept/live-ops assets)

2. Inworld AI (`inworld.ai`)
- Why strong: Official positioning around real-time voice AI for games/media characters and dynamic behaviors.
- Source:
  - https://inworld.ai/
- Added map applications:
  - `inworld -> mihoyo` (dynamic NPC dialogue)
  - `inworld -> nexon` (live-game NPC behavior)

3. Kaedim (`kaedim3d.com`)
- Why strong: Official positioning as AI-powered 3D asset production for studios/brands and game pipelines.
- Source:
  - https://www.kaedim3d.com/
- Added map applications:
  - `kaedim -> mihoyo` (2D-to-3D asset production)
  - `kaedim -> good-smile` (figure prototyping workflow)

4. Deepdub (`deepdub.ai`)
- Why strong: Official positioning as dubbing/localization platform for production voice workflows.
- Source:
  - https://deepdub.ai/
- Added map applications:
  - `deepdub -> crunchyroll` (anime localization dubbing)
  - `deepdub -> netflix` (multi-language voice localization)

5. Respeecher (`respeecher.com`)
- Why strong: Official pages explicitly cover Film/TV/Animation and Game Development voice workflows.
- Sources:
  - https://www.respeecher.com/
  - https://www.respeecher.com/game-development
- Added map applications:
  - `respeecher -> aniplex` (voice cloning for dubbing)
  - `respeecher -> crunchyroll` (localized voice production)

## Logo notes
- All added startups include `domain`, so logo loading works via the existing favicon/clearbit pipeline.
- Previously missing-logo legacy node was fixed:
  - `individual-creators` now has a dedicated custom `logo` (inline SVG) so it no longer falls back to a plain letter icon.
